## Quick Start

<Steps>

<Step title="Download and Install Modix">
  Choose one of the following methods to install Modix:

  **Method 1: Build from Source (Recommended)**

  <Note>
    **Prerequisites**: Your system must have [Rust and Cargo](https://rustup.rs/) installed.
  </Note>

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/promacanthus/modix.git
  cd modix
  cargo build --release
  ```

  After building, the binary will be located at `target/release/modix`.

  **Method 2: Pre-built Binaries**

  Pre-built binaries will be available after the first stable release.

  <Check>
    Verify installation: Run `modix --version` to confirm successful installation.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize Configuration">
  Run the initialization command to create default configuration:

  ```bash
  modix init
  ```

  This command creates a default configuration file at `~/.modix/settings.json` (or `%APPDATA%\modix\settings.json` on Windows).

  <Check>
    Configuration file created: Do not manually edit the configuration file; use commands to add API keys and enable models.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="View Current Model Status">
  Run the status command to see the current model and configuration:

  ```bash
  modix status
  ```

  This will display the current model, vendor, API endpoint, and configuration status.

  <Check>
    Current model information displayed: Confirm the model status is correct.
  </Check>
</Step>
