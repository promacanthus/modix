## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"command not found"**: Ensure the `modix` binary is in your PATH, or run it with the full path
2. **Missing configuration file**: Run `modix init` to recreate the default configuration
3. **Model switching fails**: Check that the selected model's configuration is complete
4. **API key errors**: Verify that the API key is correct and has not expired
