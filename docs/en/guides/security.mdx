## Security Considerations

<Note>
**Important Security Notice**

- API keys are currently stored as plain text in the configuration file
- Configuration files are set to 600 permissions (owner read/write only) on Unix-like systems
- **For production use, consider using environment variables or a secure key management system**

</Note>


## Recommended Security Practices

1. Use environment variables for API keys when possible
2. Set appropriate file permissions on configuration files
3. Regularly rotate API keys
4. Monitor API usage for unauthorized access
5. Consider encrypted storage solutions for sensitive configurations
